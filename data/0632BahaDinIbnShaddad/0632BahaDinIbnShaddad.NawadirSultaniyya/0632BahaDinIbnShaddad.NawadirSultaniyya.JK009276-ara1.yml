90#VERS#COMMENT##: This version is better than the Shamela one which has
        a lot of problems as far as its relationship to the edition goes (typist
        didn't type parts he considered redundant or repetitive) but had a
        cleaner digital text. I did not have access to the 1964 edition on which
        this is based, only on the 1994 reprint on which the Shamela version is
        (loosely) based -- however, I haven't been able to find a pdf of it
        online (I downloaded this version years ago). As it should essentially
        be the same text I have edited according to the newer edition. There are
        some typos in the text, and a number of pipes I didn't successfully
        delete with Regex. Digital text also still has the corresponding
        manuscript pages, but I would argue to keep those in for easy reference.
       NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): PARATEXT added. Titles that were tagged incompletely corrected. 2- I inserted the link to the 1994 edition into the VERS#LINKS. Besides, the link below is exactly the same edition (1964), but leads you to a payment-based website and you must have an account to see the PDF: https://noorlib.ir/book/view/14416?viewType=pdf
