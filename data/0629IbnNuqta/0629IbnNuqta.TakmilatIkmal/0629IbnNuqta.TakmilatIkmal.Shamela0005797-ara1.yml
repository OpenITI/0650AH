90#VERS#COMMENT##: The first edition is published in 1408, as written in the PDF, not 1410, as written in the digital version. 2- After I finished tagging 4 volumes, I realized that neither the Shamela nor the JK files include the last 2 volumes (volumes 5 and 6). So I raised a “text quality” issue for this text.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
