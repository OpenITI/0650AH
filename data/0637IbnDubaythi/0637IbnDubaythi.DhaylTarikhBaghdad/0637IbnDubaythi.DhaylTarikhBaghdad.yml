90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Dhayl by Ibn al-Dubaythī of al-Samʿānī’s dhayl of  Khaṭīb al-
    Baghdādī’s Tārīkh Baghdād. See EI2 : “[…continues the work of al-Samʿānī,
    which
    in turn was a continuation of the Taʾrīk̲h̲ Bag̲h̲dād of the K̲h̲aṭīb al-
    Bag̲h̲dādī. It is strictly biographical, containing biographies of those who
    died after the death of al-Samʿānī (562/1166), with the addition of
    biographies
    which al-Samʿānī had failed to include.”
