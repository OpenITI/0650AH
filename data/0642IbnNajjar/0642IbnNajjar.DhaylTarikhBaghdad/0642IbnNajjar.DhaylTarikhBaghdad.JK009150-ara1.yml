      NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): PARATEXT added. 2. The pipelines inside the text representing the end of the lines in the PDF should be removed. 3. The information of the publisher in the METADATA section is wrong. It is published by “Dar al-Kitab al-‘Arabi”, not “Dar al-Kutub al-‘Ilmiyya” (which is accessible here: https://archive.org/details/23_20220509/%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%20%D8%A8%D8%BA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%20%2801%29/). While the latter begins with the 16th volume, the former begins with the 15th volume. So, the volume numbers in the digital text should be reduced by one (the page numbers are correct).
