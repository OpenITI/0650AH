90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1977 edition has same pagination as 1995 edition.
    PV added pipes before the dollar signs of the lemmata
    in order to make it possible to create
    groups of lemmata (e.g., rivers, seas, monasteries, ...)
    and further hierarchy within lemmata (e.g., Baghdād, Baṣra).
    PV converted existing poetry tags (% %) into
    OpenITI mARkdown poetry tags (%~%).
    PV removed all editorial sections.
    NB: Quran quotes are in the QSxxVxx format
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 16152, 33948,
    33950, 38903, 38904, 42688, 53681, 65692, 85250, 92004, 92767, 98041, 104033
