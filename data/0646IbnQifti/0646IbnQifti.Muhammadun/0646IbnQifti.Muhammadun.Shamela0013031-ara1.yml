90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: One of the names (NO 254) includes subsections. I
    showed the subsections as paragraph with two asterisks (# **) so that
    they are distinguishable.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
