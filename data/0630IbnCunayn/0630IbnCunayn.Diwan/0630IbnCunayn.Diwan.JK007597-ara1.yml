90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche, HRH, PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: I have cleaned up the text and formatted all the poetry. I
        compared this version with the published version by Mardam Bek, but they are
        in
        fact not exactly the same. The digital edition only preserves the poems
        themselves, in the same order as the printed edition, but leaves out all the
        contextual information and the subtitles of the work. By contrast the
        digital
        edition provides the meter for every poem, which is not given by the
        edition.
        The material left out is in fact very valuable information for correctly
        interpreting the poems, so a new digital edition is needed.
        PV removed line numbers, put all meter statements on a new line,
        and completed a number of half verses absent in the digital text
        (p. 5 line 2, p. 10 line 4, p. 13 last line,
        p. 30 last line, p. 31 line 3, p. 48 lines 1-2,
        p. 64 line 7, p. 78 l. 4, p. 236 line 2)
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
