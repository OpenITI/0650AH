90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digital text needed some cleaning up. Some tags were
    for example redundant and did not appear in the pdf, so I deleted these.
    A few tags have been added in the digital text which are not as such
    highlighted in the pdf, but they are meaningful, so I have kept them,
    based on textual logic. On the other hand, the highlighting of sections
    in the text seems to be somewhat haphazard, I have mostly only tagged
    those that are highlighted unless there was a very clear situation where
    new sections start. There are still some footnote markers in the text
    (not the actual footnotes). I inserted poetry tags with regex.
    Pagination is correct for first and third volume, but not for the second
    volume (PV: page numbers in vol. 2 completely different from pdf).
    Texts goes beyond fifth-level headers, I have gone up to 8th
    level, but colours are not distinguished beyond 5th level.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Titles that were tagged incompletely corrected.
    Changes in the levelling of the headers made. Editorial removed.
