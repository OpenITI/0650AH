    "Arabic Commentaries on the Hippocratic Aphorisms"
    (2012-2017; PI: Peter Pormann, University of Manchester).
    Converted from TEI XML by PV.
    Cleaning of the structural annotation by PV
    (without access to (scans of) the original manuscripts).
    Folio numbers of the different witnesses were
    converted to OpenITI mARkdown page numbers.
    NB: witness S2 (apparently an Istanbul manuscript) is referred to
    only once in the footnotes, and its page numbers are not marked in the text.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
    Link to the text file as it was before it was cleaned:
